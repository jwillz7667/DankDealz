## Running the Application

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default, and the frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

Make sure you have MongoDB running locally or update the `MONGODB_URI` in your backend `.env` file to point to your MongoDB instance.
